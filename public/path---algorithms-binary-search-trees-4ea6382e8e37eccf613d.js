The way that they are set up means that, on average, each comparison allows the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree.</p>\n<h3>Runtime</h3>\n<p><strong>Data structure: Array</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Worst-case performance: O(log n)</li>\n<li>Best-case performance: O(1)</li>\n<li>Average performance: O(log n)</li>\n<li>Worst-case space complexity: O(1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us define a BST node having some data, referencing to its left and right child nodes.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>struct node {\n   int data;   \n   struct node *leftChild;\n   struct node *rightChild;\n};</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h2>Search Operation</h2>\n<p>Whenever an element is to be searched, start searching from the root node.
