It is often denoted with a superscript, karat, or with “to the power of” such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2<sup>3</sup></li>\n<li>2^3</li>\n<li>2 to the power of 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this example, 3 is the exponent. </p>\n<p>To compute the value of 2<sup>3</sup>, you would multiple 2 to itself 3 times: 2 * 2 * 2.  This evalutes to 8.</p>\n<p>Common exponents have special names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exponent of 2 is often referred to as squared.  So 3<sup>2</sup> is referred to as 3 squared, evaluating to 9.</li>\n<li>Exponent of 3 is often referred to as cubed.  So 2<sup>3</sup> is referred to as 3 cubed, evaluating to 8.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Negative Exponents</h3>\n<p>Negative exponents are computed similarly, except the value is placed as a denominator beneath a numerator of 1.</p>\n<p>For example, 2<sup>-2</sup> = 1/(2*2) = 1/4</p>\n<h3>More Examples</h3>\n<p>2<sup>5</sup>  = 2<em>2</em>2<em>2</em>2 = 32</p>\n<p>-2<sup>5</sup>  = -2<em>-2</em>-2<em>-2</em>-2 = 32</p>\n<p>10<sup>6</sup> = 1,000,000</p>\n<p>2<sup>-5</sup> = 1/(2<em>2</em>2<em>2</em>2) = 32</p>",fields:{slug:"/mathematics/exponents/"},frontmatter:{title:"Exponents"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/mathematics/exponents/"}}}});
