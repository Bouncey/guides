To find the median, we arrange the observations in order from smallest to largest value. If there is an odd number of observations, the median is the middle value. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the (mean) average of the two middle values.</p>\n<h4>Example 1:</h4>\n<p>In the data set [3, 4, 8, 6, 34, 22, 5], to find the median we sort the set to [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 22, 34]. The middle value i.e. 6 is the median.</p>\n<h4>xample 1:</h4>\n<p>In the data set [3, 4, 8, 6, 22, 5], to find the median we sort the set to [3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 22]. The average of 5 and 6 i.e. 5.5 is the median.</p>\n<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
