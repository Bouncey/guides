It is typically part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product).</li>\n<li><strong>Should have</strong>: Important but not necessary for delivery in the current delivery timebox. </li>\n<li><strong>Could have</strong>: Desirable but not necessary, an improvement.</li>\n<li><strong>Won’t have</strong>: Least-critical, lowest-payback items, or not appropriate at this time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By prioritizing in this way, a common definition of the project can be reached and stakeholders’ expectations set accordingly. Note That MoSCoW is a bit lax about how to distinguish the category of an item and when something will be done, if not in this timebox.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">Wikipedia</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/agile/moscow/"},frontmatter:{title:"Moscow"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/moscow/"}}}});
