A great way to think of this would be like the blueprint of a car or building. The blueprint will allow you to build several cars or several buildings in the same manner after designing the actual layout once.</p>\n<h3>Use Cases</h3>\n<p>Unlike the CSS “ID” class names are not unique. Therefore, it is fine for you to use a “class” several times if you would like for these elements to have the same styling applied. In fact, this would be a great time for you to use a “class.” If you would like for three “div” elements in your HTML to have a blue background you could use a class once in your CSS as seen in the example below.</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code><html>\n<style>\n  .blueBg {\n    background-color: blue;\n  }\n</style>\n  <body>\n    <div class="blueBg"></div>\n    <div class="blueBg"></div>\n    <div class="blueBg"></div>\n  </body>\n</html></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<!-- Please add any articles you think might be helpful to read before writing the article -->\n<p>If you would like to learn more information on the CSS “class” selector please visit <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">this page</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/css/selectors/attribute/class/"},frontmatter:{title:"Class"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/css/selectors/attribute/class/"}}}});
