This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.\nThe objective of grooming is to have enough Product Backlog items “Ready” for the next Sprint’s Sprint Planning. Generally, a scrum team will collaboratively refine product backlog items for the next two to three sprints.</p>\n<p>Backlog emergence and grooming are essential tasks for every scrum team. The Product Owner defines the scope of the upcoming sprints by identifying and triaging the most valuable user stories in the product backlog. Although the Product Owner is in charge of keeping the product backlog at peak value delivery, they need the assistance of the entire Scrum Team to do so. Changing the Sprint Backlog is part of the ongoing Sprint and is not considered Grooming. </p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/optimizing-product-backlog-refinement">Optimizing Product Backlog Refinement</a></li>\n<li>Scrum Guide (<a href="http://www.scrumguides.org/">http://www.scrumguides.org/</a>)</li>\n</ul>',fields:{slug:"/agile/backlog-emergence-and-grooming/"},frontmatter:{title:"Backlog Emergence and Grooming"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/agile/backlog-emergence-and-grooming/"}}}});
