Service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between different services that run over transport protocols such as TCP, UDP, DCCP, and SCTP.\nWhen a computer receives a message from an another source the ports will help in determining which process is expecting that message.</p>\n<p>A port is always related to an ip adress of a host and the protocol type of the communication, and thus completes the destination or origination network address of a communication session. There is 65536 available ports in operating system. A port is identified for each address and protocol by a 16-bit number, commonly known as the port number. For example, an address may be “protocol: TCP, IP address: 1.2.3.4, port number: 80”, which may be written 1.2.3.4:80 when the protocol is known from context.\nSome port numbers are used by convention to identify specific services, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 - FTP</li>\n<li>21 - FTP</li>\n<li>22 - SSH</li>\n<li>23 - Telnet</li>\n<li>25 - SMTP</li>\n<li>42 - nameserver</li>\n<li>80 - http</li>\n<li>110 - pop3</li>\n<li>143 - imap</li>\n<li>194 - irc</li>\n<li>443 - https</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
