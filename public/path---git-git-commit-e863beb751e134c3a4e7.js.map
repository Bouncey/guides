However, this guide will only cover the two most common options. For an extensive list of options, please consult the <a href=\\\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit\\\">Git documentation</a>.</p>\\n<h4>The -m Option</h4>\\n<p>The most common option used with <code>git commit</code> is the <code>-m</code> option. The <code>-m</code> stands for message. When calling <code>git commit</code>, it is required to include a message. The message should be a short description of the changes being committed. The message should be at the end of the command and it must be wrapped in quotations <code>\\\" \\\"</code>.</p>\\n<p>An example of how to use the <code>-m</code> option:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>git commit -m \\\"My message\\\"</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The output in your terminal should look something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>[master 13vc6b2] My message\\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If the <code>-m</code> is not included with the <code>git commit</code> command, you will be prompted to add a message in your default text editor - see ‘Using detailed commit messages’ below.</p>\\n<h4>The -a Option</h4>\\n<p>Another popular option is the <code>-a</code> option. The <code>-a</code> stands for all. This option automatically stages all modified files to be committed. If new files are added the <code>-a</code> option will not stage those new files. Only files that the Git repository is aware of will be committed.</p>\\n<p>For example:</p>\\n<p>Let’s say that you have a <code>README.md</code> file that has already been committed to your repository. If you make changes to this file, you can use the <code>-a</code> option in your commit command to stage and add the changes to your repository. However, what if you also added a new file called <code>index.html</code>? The <code>-a</code> option will not stage the <code>index.html</code> as it does not currently exist in the repository. When new files have been added, the <code>git add</code> command should be invoked in order to stage the files before they can be committed to the repository.</p>\\n<p>An example of how to use the <code>-a</code> option:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>git commit -am “My new changes”</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>The output in your terminal should look something like this:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>[master 22gc8v1] My new message\\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<h3>Using detailed commit messages</h3>\\n<p>Although <code>git commit -m \\\"commit message\\\"</code> works just fine, it can be useful to provide more detailed and systmatic information.</p>\\n<p>If you commit without using the <code>-m</code> option, git will open your default text editor with a new file, which will include a commented-out list of all the files/changes that are staged in the commit. You then write your detailed commit message (the first line will be treated as the subject line) and the commit will be performed when you save/close the file.</p>\\n<p>Bear in mind:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>Keep your commit message lines length less than 72 charcters as standard practice</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>It is perfectly ok - and even recommended - to write multiline commit messages</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You can also refer to other issues or pull requests in your commit message. GitHub allocated a number reference to all pull requests and issues, so for example if you want to refer to pull request #788 simply do so in either the subject-line or in the body text as appropriate</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h4>The —amend Option</h4>\\n<p>The <code>--amend</code> option allows you to change your last commit. Let’s say you just committed and you made a mistake in your commit log message. You can conveniently modify the most recent commit using the command:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>git commit --amend -m \\\"an updated commit message\\\"</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>If you forget to include a file in the commit:</p>\\n<div class=\\\"gatsby-highlight\\\">\\n      <pre class=\\\"language-shell\\\"><code>git add FORGOTTEN-FILE-NAME\\ngit commit --amend -m \\\"an updated commit message\\\"\\n\\n# If you don't need to change the commit message, use the --no-edit option\\ngit add FORGOTTEN-FILE-NAME\\ngit commit --amend --no-edit</code></pre>\\n      </div>\\n<p>Premature commits happen all the time in the course of your day-to-day development. It’s easy to forget to stage a file or how to correctly format your commit message. The <code>--amend</code> flag is a convenient way to fix these minor mistakes. This command will replace the old commit message with the updated one specified in the command.</p>\\n<p>Amended commits are actually entirely new commits and the previous commit will no longer be on your current branch. When you’re working with others, you should try to avoid amending commits if the last commit is already pushed into the repository.</p>\\n<h3>More Information:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Git documentation: <a href=\\\"https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit\\\">commit</a></li>\\n</ul>\",\"fields\":{\"slug\":\"/git/git-commit/\"},\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Git Commit\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/git/git-commit/\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---git-git-commit-e863beb751e134c3a4e7.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<h2>Git Commit</h2>\\n<p>The <code>git commit</code> command will save all staged changes, along with a brief description from the user, in a “commit” to the local repository.</p>\\n<p>Commits are at the heart of Git usage.
