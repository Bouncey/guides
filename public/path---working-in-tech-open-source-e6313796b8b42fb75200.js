Anyone is capable of creating an open source project.</p>\n<p>Open source projects are legally made open through a creative license. They are changed, maintained, or abandoned by their creators at any time. Many open source projects have contributors that volunteer to add and edit code, and a growing number of open source projects are taking a major place among the most popular software available today.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest Open Source project is Linux.</p>\n<h3>Advantages</h3>\n<p>Open source is not dependent on the company or author that originally created it. In a situation in which the company fails, the code continues to exist and the users will keep developing it. Also, it uses open standards accessible to everyone; thus, it does not have the problem of incompatible formats that exist in proprietary software.</p>\n<p>Also, the companies using open-source software do not have to think about complex licensing models and do not need anti-piracy measures like product activation or serial number.</p>\n<h3>Disadvantages</h3>\n<p>The main disadvantage of open-source software is that often it is not very straightforward to use. Open-source operating systems like Linux cannot be learned in a day. They require continuous effort and training from your side before you are able to master them. You may need to hire a trained person to make things easier, but this will incur additional costs.</p>\n<p>In short, Open source softwares are typically of <strong>lower cost</strong>, <strong>higher security</strong> and <strong>better quality</strong> when compared to proprietary software.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest Open Source projects is Linux.</p>\n<h4>More Information:</h4>\n<p><a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_model">Wikipedia Open Source Model</a>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Wikipedia Open Source Software</a></p>',fields:{slug:"/working-in-tech/open-source/"},frontmatter:{title:"Open Source"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/working-in-tech/open-source/"}}}});
